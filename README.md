This project has it's own installer created using WinRAR SFX.
You can also get the latest installer through my site: https://czompi.hu/project

The installer will create two shortcuts on desktop. One is the application itself, named YouTubeTV and the another one is called YouTubeTV Settings and it allows you to select which display you'd like to show the application.

You could exit the application using `Alt`+`F4`.
